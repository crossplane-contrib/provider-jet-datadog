`provider-jet-datadog` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Terrajet](https://github.com/crossplane/terrajet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
Datadog API.

## Getting Started

to the [latest release](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-jet-datadog/releases):

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
